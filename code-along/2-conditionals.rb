# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 2-conditionals.rb

# Booleans
# is_true = true
# is_false = false

# puts is_true
# puts is_false


# Boolean Expressions

# puts 3 > 2
# puts 3 < 2
# puts 3 == 2
# # use two equal signs because a single = means assignment 

# # If Conditional Logic

# if 3 > 5
#     puts "awesome"
#     puts "math works"

# end

# If/Else Conditional Logic

# password = "Tacos"
# user_entered_password = "password"
# if password == user_entered_password
#     puts "you're in!"
# else
#     puts "go away!"
# end



# # Elsif Conditional Logic

# home_team_score = 101
# away_team_score = 101

# if home_team_score > away_team_score
#     puts "winner!"
# elsif home_team_score < away_team_score
#     puts "loser!"
# else 
#     puts "tied, meh"
# end



# Combining Expressions

temp = 68

# && is AND -> both sides must be true
if temp < 80 && temp > 60
    puts "it's beautiful"
else 
    puts "damn"
end

# || is OR --> one of the sides must be true
